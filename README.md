Knowledge - Design Patterns
====================

Note: Here are not exhausted knowledge about patterns.

### Replacing Object-Oriented Patterns with Functional Approach:
 [Functional Interface](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/Functional_Interface.md)
 [State-Carrying Functional Interface](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/State-Carrying_Functional_Interface.md)

#### Creational (gof):
  - Patterns create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly. This makes program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
  - [Builder](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/Builder.md)
  - [Factory method](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/Factory_Method.md)
  - Singleton https://pavelfatin.com/design-patterns-in-scala/

#### Behavioral (gof):
 - Patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
 - [Command](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/Command.md)
 - [Iterator](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/Iterator.md)
 - [Template Method](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/Template_Method.md)
 - [Strategy](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/Strategy.md)
 - Visitor
 - Chain of responsibility https://pavelfatin.com/design-patterns-in-scala/
 - Dependency Injection (not gof)
 - [Null Object](https://github.com/OndrejKucera/knowledge_patterns/blob/master/Null_Object.md) (not gof)

#### Structural (gof):
 - Decorator
 - Adapter https://pavelfatin.com/design-patterns-in-scala/

### Functional Patterns:
1) Tail Recursion
2) Mutual Recursion
3) Filter-Map-Reduce
4) Function Builder
5) Memoization
6) Lazy sequence
7) Focused Mutability
8) Customized Control Flow
9) Domain-Specific Language
