## Filter-Map-Reduce

To manipulate a sequence (list, vector, and so on) declaratively using filter, map, and reduce to produce a new one
 - `filter` function to select the elements we care about
 - `map` to transform each element
 - `reduce`, sometimes known as fold, to combine the results.
 - Sometimes, it could be hard to write algorithm with filter-map-reduce style, then we should look at the related paterns.
 - Related patterns: [Replacing Iterator](), [Tail Recursion](), [Mutual Recursion]()
