## Decorator

It allows to change the behavior of an existing class.
 - To add behavior to an individual object rather than to an entire class of objects.
 - There is class that we need to add some behavior to but we can’t change the existing class. But we can’t change every other part of the system where the class is used. Or the class may be part of a library that we can’t, or don’t want to, modify.
 - Also know as Wrapper

### Java Examples
 - We have 2 parts, interface and implemantation in class which we don't want to change
 - Then we implement the interface with an abstract decorator class as a solution
 ```java
 ```

### Scala Replacement
 ```scala
 ```
